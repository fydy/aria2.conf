`ytdlrc` is a simple shell script wrapper for `youtube-dl` and `rclone`. It
downloads videos and metadata via `youtube-dl` and moves each file on
completion to an `rclone` remote, e.g. Google Drive.

## About

*   Designed to be executed via cron job or manually.

*   Ideal for use on VPS's with small disk space as it moves files on
    completion rather than copying them. In testing I downloaded / uploaded
    ~500GB of videos on a VPS with a 15GB SSD.

    *   This can easily be changed to keep the files if you have the disk
        space; see the `rclone_command` variable to do so.

*   Includes metadata (xattrs, \*.info.json, \*.description, \*.jpg).

*   Reads a file named `snatch.list` to know which URL's / channels /
    playlists you want to download and monitor for new videos.

    *   Lines beginning with `#` are ignored.

*   Completed video ID's are saved in a file named `archive.list`; this
    prevents `youtube-dl` from re-downloading videos that have already been
    processed and moved to the rclone remote.

*   By default, it creates / uses the following structure:

    *   `~/ytdlrc/stage`           - download directory
    *   `~/ytdlrc/snatch.list`     - list of usernames or URL's to monitor / download
    *   `~/ytdlrc/archive.list`    - list of completed video ID's

    These paths can be changed by modifying the `ytdl_*` variables.

*   In the download directory, subfolders are created for each line in the
    `snatch.list`. The name of the subfolders depends on whether the
    processed line is a playlist or a channel. This results in the following
    structure:

    *   `~/ytdlrc/stage/Some_Channel_Name/{downloaded files}`
    *   `~/ytdlrc/stage/Another_Channel_Name/{downloaded files}`
    *   `~/ytdlrc/stage/Some_Playlist_Name/{downloaded files}`
    *   `~/ytdlrc/stage/Another_Playlist_Name/{downloaded files}`

    Upon download completion a file is moved to the rclone remote, creating
    a structure such as:

    *   `remote:archive/youtube/Some_Channel_Name/{downloaded files}`
    *   `remote:archive/youtube/Another_Channel_Name/{downloaded files}`
    *   `remote:archive/youtube/Some_Playlist_Name/{downloaded files}`
    *   `remote:archive/youtube/Another_Playlist_Name/{downloaded files}`

    The path before the channel / playlist names (`remote:archive/youtube`)
    is set via the `rclone_destination` variable.

*   Downloaded files are saved with the following output template:

    `"%(uploader)s.%(upload_date)s.%(title)s.%(resolution)s.%(id)s.%(ext)s"`

    This results in filenames such as:

    *   `Channel_Name.20170307.Video_Title.1920x1080.J---aiyznGQ.mp4`
    *   `Channel_Name.20170307.Video_Title.1920x1080.J---aiyznGQ.info.json`
    *   `Channel_Name.20170307.Video_Title.1920x1080.J---aiyznGQ.description`
    *   `Channel_Name.20170307.Video_Title.1920x1080.J---aiyznGQ.jpg`

    See the `ytdl_output_template` variable if you wish to use a different
    output template.

## Example Output

These examples are what you see with `debug=true`.

### Example: Initial execution

```text
[YTDLRC] Lock file doesn't exist. Attempting to create /tmp/ytdlrc.lock...
[YTDLRC] Creating '/tmp/ytdlrc.lock' succeeded. Continuing...
[YTDLRC] Creating download directory: /home/brian/ytdlrc/stage
[YTDLRC] Creating snatch list: /home/brian/ytdlrc/snatch.list
[YTDLRC] Creating archive list: /home/brian/ytdlrc/archive.list
[YTDLRC] Process complete. Removing lock file.
```

### Example: Downloading all videos from ytuser:kurzgesagt

`ytuser:kurzgesagt` is the only line in our `snatch.list`.

#### First run

```text

```

All available videos were already downloaded and moved to the rclone remote,
so there was nothing to be done on the second run other than check for new
uploads.

## Installation

1.  [Download](https://github.com/bardisty/ytdlrc/archive/master.zip) or
    clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/bardisty/ytdlrc`

2.  `cd` into the directory:

    `cd ytdlrc`

3.  Open `ytdlrc` in your text editor and see [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

1.  Ensure the path to your rclone configuration file is correct or modify
    it if need be:

    ```shell
    rclone_config="${HOME}/.config/rclone/rclone.conf"
    ```

2.  Modify the `rclone_destination` variable with your rclone remote
    destination path, e.g.:

    ```diff
    - rclone_destination="remote:archive/youtube"
    + rclone_destination="gdrive:archive/youtube"
    ```

3.  Run the script once to generate the working directory, download
    directory, snatch list, and archive list:

    ```text
    $ ./ytdlrc
    [YTDLRC] Creating download directory: /home/brian/ytdlrc/stage
    [YTDLRC] Creating snatch list: /home/brian/ytdlrc/snatch.list
    [YTDLRC] Creating archive list: /home/brian/ytdlrc/archive.list
    [YTDLCR] Process complete. Removing lock file.
    ```

4.  Put the URL's / channels / playlists you want to download in the
    `snatch.list` file, one per line, e.g.:

    *   `ytuser:username`
    *   `https://www.youtube.com/user/username`
    *   `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK9Sc5q_4K6aNajVLKtkaAB1JGmKyccf2`

5.  *(Optional / Recommended)* Run the script once or twice with debugging
    enabled (`debug=true`) to ensure everything is okie dokie. Disable
    debugging when done if you don't want `ytdlrc` to spam your system log
    when executed via cron.

6.  Set up a cron job to execute the script however often you want, e.g.:

    ```crontab
    # Every 6 hours
    30 */6 * * * /home/your-user/bin/ytdlrc
    ```

    *   If you set up the cron job by moving the `ytdlrc` file to one of the
        `/etc/cron.*/` directories, you may want to modify the
        `rclone_config` variable with the path to your rclone config,
        otherwise it will look inside `/root` for your config file:

        ```diff
        - rclone_config="${HOME}/.config/rclone/rclone.conf"
        + rclone_config="/home/your-user/.config/rclone/rclone.conf"
        ```

        You may also want to modify the `ytdl_root_dir` variable so runtime
        files aren't created inside `/root`:

        ```diff
        - ytdl_root_dir="${HOME}/ytdlrc"
        + ytdl_root_dir="/home/your-user/ytdlrc"
        ```

7.  *(Optional)* Commit your configuration changes so you can easily remain
    updated with the upstream version of the script:

    ```shell
    git add ytdlrc
    git commit -m "Modify options to my taste"
    ```

    To update the script to the latest version simply run `git pull` and
    merge any changes.

## Requirements

*   [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html)
*   [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
*   [rclone >= v1.43](http://rclone.org/)
*   [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)
